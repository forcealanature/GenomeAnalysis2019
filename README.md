# GenomeAnalysis2019
Contact: DM

Welcome to my repository for the project in the course Genome Analysis spring 2019 at Uppsala University. 
I worked with scaffold 6 from paper V, assembling a part of the Durian fruit. 

I tried to keep my GitHub structure as similar to my Uppmax structure as possible. 

code - all code is found here. Some analysis parts have multiple code commitments. There is a "detailed" description added for every script. See that for more information. Under code there is also a subfolder called slumr_logs, this folder does not contain the actual slumr logs as those were deleted from my account when dealing with space issues, but printscreens of the emails I recieved from rackham for at least some of the analysis. Had I been aware of the request of slumr-logs earlier I would have saved these. 

raw_data - softlinks to all the rawdata i used, provided by the course teachers. Also contains the 49 genes provided by the authors of the paper for phylogenetic analysis. 

backup_data - data generated from analysis that I wanted saved, such as my genome assembly and tophat runs (for example). 

results - the output files from some final analysis, such as images etc. 

For more and most details see my wiki.
