ACTUALLY DOING STUFF IN SHORT (once you have the account): 
To sign in: 
Open terminal type: 
ssh -AX username@rackham.uppmax.uu.se
password
#preferably use -ax flag, there are a number of flags that work. 

#To move from your home to the acoel projects cd to them straight, their paths are: 
Working project: /proj/snic2020-15-191
Storage project: /proj/snic2020-16-132

#I recommend setting up a your bash profile in your home, although with caution to not delete anything,
#to have certain flags and like paths added with shortcuts so you dont have to type the full path all the time
#although I am too lazy to have done that myself. To do this ill ad the info but its in your bin/bash home directoy.

INSTALLATION OF SOFTWARES: 
#You can install your own stuff
#But before installing check if thing is available on uppmax at:https://uppmax.uu.se/resources/software/installed-software/
#I recommend doing this in the working project bin, making it accessable to all collaborators on the project if they run
PATH="$PATH:/proj/snic2020-15-191/bin" (Or whatever the path to the bin is with "")
#it makes the bin your path, like I talked about the bash profile above and uppmax will find the stuff in the bin as something already installed.

RULES AND RECOMMENDATIONS: 
#Do not run heavy jobs on the login node. Everyone will hate you.
#SLURM works like a que, if your project still has hours for the month (last 30 days) you have priority, otherwise you are bottom of the food chain based
#on cores requested and runtime. Do not ask for too much more than needed if your project is/almost is out. 
#all hours you do not use goes back to the project after the run terminates. 
#You can ssh into specific nodes that are free and put your run on them - so called interactive jobs - to avoid a long SLURM que
#Split big jobs in smaller if possible, make one script that submitts the rest as new jobs with lower requirments making them skip the que.
#for doing any bioinfo work you need to load a special model, bioinfo-tools using command module load. More about this in the helpful command document.
